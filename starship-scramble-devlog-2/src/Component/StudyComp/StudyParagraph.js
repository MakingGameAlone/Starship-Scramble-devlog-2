            <h4>Origin</h4>

            <p>I didn't start this project as dream game, in fact, I was developping the dream game but I took departure from the road and start this development, due to computer issue.
                I didn't expect to build a full game at first, however, the game idea kept me interested after I resolved the computer's problem. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I chose the Arena shooter roguelike genre for this game. One major reason is workload, I am undergraduatee that must take presure from university and work; plus the fact that arena shooter roguelike genre is much smaller in scope.
                The game have been underdevelopment for nearly 1 year and I am happy with the current result and my hard work.

            <h4>Case Study 1: Soulstone survivor</h4>
            <p>To be honest, I don't quite like this game, however, I have spent over 30 hours in this game due to the grinding system. </p>

            <p>    At the start, I notice the issue with this game VFX, every thing is flashy and awesome which really makes nothing flashy and awesome.
                 Different characters are enjoyable, but I notice my favourites are the ones who have subtle vfx and therefore, the vfx I selected in Starship Scramble are much visible and comprehensive.
                 Secondly, I enjoy the color selection for each type of element. It create a sense of order in such a chaos game! I decided to reform the arsenal system followed this example.

            <h4>Case Study 2: Hades</h4>
            <p>One of my favorite videogame, I spent around 100 hours to complete every single achievement.</p>
            <p>Hades is my source of inspiration for multiple-resource system, construction and upgrade. Different resources are used for different purpose, which allows players options based on their need.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mirror of Night is a stats upgrade system in Hades and it is amazing. Normally, in any other games, I would simply pump the money to all the stats (becase I can); however, Mirror of night requires players to choose which stats for the next run.
                A feature in roguelike is choice and to force players strategicly think to win long term and shorterm is totally an achievement in game design! Therefore, I copy and paste it into the game with certain twist and exaggeration.

            <h4>Case Study 3: Brotato</h4>
            <p>I haven't tried this game! Yet my radar still catches the strange popularity of this game. </p>
